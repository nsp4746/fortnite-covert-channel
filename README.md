# Fortnite Covert Channel

  This repository gives you a dictionary that can be used to encode messages within Fortnite. It gives the user a list of weapons that correspond to their string that they want to encode. This will allow the user to use these items in Fortnite Creative in their map so that they can encode a message in their map. They can also use this code to decode their message, by passing in the names of the weapons into the decoder.
